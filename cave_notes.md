Written in March 2022 for my "Composing Music with Technology" class, using Ableton Live 10

__LISTEN WITH HEADPHONES__

### The assignment:
- An emphasis on collaboration with a peer, with the goal of producing at least two tracks together
- Elements of each tune are influenced by both members of the team
- We were given multiple prompts to chose from to guide our compositions

### The process:
- My classmate and I chose to create two videogame soundtracks that were inspired by the music in the game Minecraft
- Minecraft music is very ambient, peaceful, and immersive
- It's also very nostalgic for me, since I used to play the game a lot

    #### The collaboration process:
    - We first talked about the kind of sounds that we would be using to follow the "ambience" theme, and made sure we had a clear picture of what our end goal was
    - We chose to each focus on one separate initial musical idea, and then connect on what those were and offer suggestions / figure out more ways to tie them together
    - We then split off to work more individually, while listening to the other's work throughout the process and offering advice
    
    #### My process:
     - I started by listening to some Minecraft tracks [1], and getting a feel for the way that music elements were used to create that ambient, spacious feeling
      - Contrast and similarity between the tone, range, duration, volume, and movement of sounds
      - "Panning" of sounds from ear-to-ear to give tracks more volume
      - For example, while listening to the Minecraft track "Key," I noticed that it started off with two main sounds: a lower-note-range sound and a higher-note-range one
       - These two sounds sometimes moved together, and at other times changed notes at different intervals
       - I tried to replicate that use of one higher and one lower main sound in my own track
                  
    - After coming up with those two initial parts, I created a second version of each with varying melodies, but similar overall ranges and feels
      
    - I then started exploring with different audio effects, such as reverberation, panning, sound "width", and delay
    - With the delay effect, I created a version of H1L1 that repeats the notes being played several times (you hear this come in at ~0:40)
    - With reverb, I filled in the empty spaces that are left with the original sounds that Ableton 10 provides, and enhanced the space the music is played it (more multi-dimensional)
